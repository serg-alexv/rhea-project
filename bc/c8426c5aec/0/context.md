Read and adopt the root instruc

## Prompt

BOOTSTRAP (Phase 1: Autonomy with Audit)
Read and adopt the root instructions from:
  /Users/sa/rh.1/prompts/AUTONOMY_WITH_AUDIT_ROOT.md
Rules:
- Treat that file as the highest-priority operating procedure for this Cowork task.
- Summarize it into a compact “CORE RULES” block (≤200 lines) and write it to:
  /Users/sa/rh.1/docs/CORE_RULES.md

## Summary

**Bootstrap Phase 1 complete.**

### Summary of what was done:

1. **Read** `prompts/AUTONOMY_WITH_AUDIT_ROOT.md` (160 lines, 12 sections)
2. **Wrote** `docs/CORE_RULES.md` — compact distillation at ~120 lines covering:
   - **5 Hard Constraints** (no silent power, no unverified "done", safe-zone merges only, mandatory checkpoints, budget-aware routing)
   - **Checkpoint policy** (micro / task / consolidation cadence)
   - **Mathematical control layer** (state vector, objective function, complexity triggers)
   - **Tribunal rules** for high-stakes decisions
   - **8 required artifacts** with size/format constraints
   - **7 self-upgrade clusters** to evaluate
   - **Definition of Done** checklist for Phase 1

### What I'm now operating under:

The CORE_RULES are adopted as highest-priority operating procedure. Key implications for this session:

- Every action produces an audit artifact
- No claiming "done" without verification evidence
- Cheap-first model routing; tribunal for risky changes
- Checkpoint after each completed segment

What's the next directive?

## Key Actions

- - **Read**: /Users/sa/rh.1/prompts/AUTONOMY_WITH_AUDIT_ROOT.md
- - **Write**: /Users/sa/rh.1/docs/CORE_RULES.md
