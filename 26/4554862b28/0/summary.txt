`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The 9 unpushed commits are a liability — violates the 30-min push mandate. The missing genome-evidence file is the critical blocker: either it was never produced by COWORK/Argos, or it was lost in the relay system. The outbox already has `TO_COWORK_P0_genome-evidence-recovery.md` — someone already noticed and requested recovery, but no response arrived.
