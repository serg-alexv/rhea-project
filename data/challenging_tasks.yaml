    title: "Fourier decomposition of real circadian data"
    description: |
      The paper outline claims Fourier analysis of circadian/ultradian/infradian rhythms
      but we have no actual data or worked example. Need real-world HRV or actigraphy dataset,
      apply FFT, extract dominant frequencies, validate against known biological oscillators.
    why_challenging: "Requires domain expertise (chronobiology + signal processing) and real data."

    title: "Bayesian prior calibration for passive profiling"
    description: |
      ADR-005 specifies passive profiling (no questionnaires), but the mathematical framework
      references Bayesian state estimation. Need to define actual priors for the state vector
      x_t = [E, M, C, S, O, R] — what distributions? What sensor data maps to what variable?
    why_challenging: "Ambiguity in mapping behavioral signals to psychological state."

    title: "LangGraph state machine — formal graph definition"
    description: |
      Design the actual state graph: nodes (agents), edges (transitions), memory flow.
      Must handle: normal operation, reflexive sprint, error recovery, oracle consultation.
    why_challenging: "Architecture design with many interacting agents and states."

    title: "Cross-cultural calendar convergence proof"
    description: |
      42 calendar systems from 16+ civilizations — prove mathematically that they converge
      on the same biological rhythms. This is the core thesis of the paper.
    why_challenging: "Requires deep cultural knowledge + mathematical formalization."

    title: "MPC controller for daily schedule optimization"
    description: |
      Model Predictive Control for generating optimal daily schedules from state vector.
      Needs: cost function, horizon, constraints from real-world obligations.
    why_challenging: "Control theory applied to human behavior — novel formulation needed."

    title: "Tribunal consensus — semantic similarity vs count-based"
    description: |
      Current tribunal in rhea_bridge.py uses simple majority voting.
      Need semantic embedding similarity to detect when models agree in meaning
      but differ in wording.
    why_challenging: "Requires embedding infrastructure + threshold calibration."

    title: "Entire.io ↔ LangGraph checkpoint integration"
    description: |
      Design how Entire.io episodic memory integrates with LangGraph's built-in
      checkpointing. Avoid duplication, ensure both systems see same state.
    why_challenging: "Two checkpoint systems that must coexist without conflicts."
