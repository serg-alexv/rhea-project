  "state_md": "# Rhea — compact state\n\n## Mission\nMind Blueprint factory: generate, evaluate, iterate on daily structure models using scientific rhythms, multi-model tribunal, and closed-loop planner.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Scientific paper \"Mathematics of Rhea\" → outline ready (docs/prism_paper_outline.md)\n- iOS app \"Rhea\" (SwiftUI + HealthKit + Apple Watch)\n- Multi-provider bridge rhea_bridge.py → ✅ implemented (src/rhea_bridge.py)\n\n## Status\n- Architecture: v3 fixed, 8 agents, Chronos Protocol\n- Bridge: implemented (6 providers, ask/tribunal/models_status)\n- Docs: normalized, prism paper outline created\n- Ops: ./rhea CLI + .entire snapshots/logs working\n- Memory economy: D=91.96 (comfort), T1=150, T2=300 — ADR-010\n- LangGraph: design phase (docs/langgraph_architecture.md)\n- Git: PR#2 merged, main up to date\n- Entire.io: manual-commit strategy, checkpoint pipeline working (2 checkpoints on GitHub)\n\n## Entire.io Integration\n- Strategy: manual-commit (trailers added to user commits)\n- Hooks: commit-msg (chmod +x fixed), post-commit, pre-push — all working\n- Checkpoints on GitHub: 9f2cf70d71cb, b0010aef23e3 (entire/checkpoints/v1 branch)\n- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Install Entire GitHub App at github.com/apps/entire → grant access to rhea-project\n- SSH key for push: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_rhea\n- Worktree cleanup needed: `git worktree remove /tmp/entire-wt` (run from macOS terminal)\n\n## Next\n1. **Install Entire GitHub App** → checkpoints visible at entire.io dashboard\n2. Wire bridge to .env keys → first live tribunal\n3. iOS MVP scaffold (Stage 1)\n4. Feed prism_paper_outline.md to OpenAI Prism\n\n## Refs\n- Full state: docs/state_full.md\n- Decisions: docs/decisions.md\n- Architecture: docs/architecture.md",
