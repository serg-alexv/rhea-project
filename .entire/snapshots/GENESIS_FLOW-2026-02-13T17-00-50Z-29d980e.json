    "A2": "[A2 RESPONSE]\n\n**Polyvagal-Interoception Bridge Review:**\nThe bridge concept is neurophysiologically sound. Vagal tone directly modulates interoceptive accuracy through the vagus nerve's afferent pathways to the insular cortex. Higher HRV correlates with better interoceptive sensitivity, which is crucial for ADHD self-regulation given baseline interoceptive deficits.\n\n**Circabidian Hypothesis Validation:**\nPlausible but requires qualification. ADHD shows documented circadian dysregulation (delay",
    "A3": "[A3 RESPONSE]\n\nZero-questionnaire approach confirmed viable. Current state vector captures core ADHD executive dysfunction markers but needs refinement:\n\n**Adequate coverage:**\n- E_t (energy) → tracks dopamine availability patterns\n- C_t (cognitive load) → executive function demand/capacity ratio\n- S_t (sleep debt) → critical for ADHD emotional regulation\n\n**Missing dimensions for executive dysfunction:**\n- Attention residue from task-switching\n- Hyperfocus/flow state detection\n- Rejection sensi",
    "A4": "[A4 RESPONSE]\n\n**Critical Underrepresented Cultures for Phase 2:**\n\n1. **Andean civilizations** - Inca decimal calendar + pre-Inca lunar systems. Essential for high-altitude chronobiology patterns.\n\n2. **Polynesian navigation cultures** - Star compass temporal systems. Critical for understanding non-land-based time perception.\n\n3. **Arctic peoples** (Inuit/Sami) - Extreme photoperiod adaptation. Validates circadian flexibility claims.\n\n4. **Australian Aboriginal** - 65,000+ year continuous cultu",

Read-only wrapper.\n2. **Simple State Store** - ObservableObject holding current x_t vector (6 floats)\n3. **Main Dashboard** - Single view showing current state as basic gauges/bars\n4. **Manual Input Sheet** - Sliders for mood/energy/cognitive load when HealthKit gaps exist\n5. **Basic Persistence** - Core Data entity storing daily snapshots\n\n**SwiftUI Str",

    "A8": "[A8 RESPONSE]\n\nUpon reviewing the GENESIS_INIT snapshot and the responses from all agents, my analysis is as follows:\n\n1. **Logical Gaps:**\n   - The state vector \\( x_t \\) lacks explicit representation of social interactions and environmental context, which are critical for episodic memory and may influence other variables like mood (M_t) and energy (E_t).\n   - There's an absence of feedback mechanisms to adjust the state vector based on historical data and outcomes, which is essential for refin"
