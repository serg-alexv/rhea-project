# Session Context

**Session ID:** 776e45e3-e3cf-4439-b48b-57cd241ea338

**Commit Message:** Plase always save each insight in file and share w other -- this is on r

## Prompt

plase always save each insight in file and share w other -- this is on regular basis!

## Summary

Done. Two things created:

1. **`REDACTED.md`** — running insights log with all 5 insights from this session so far. Lives in the outbox so every agent (HYPERION, ORION, GPT, B2) can read it.

2. **MEMORY.md updated** — added "Standing Practices" section so every future session knows to save insights to outbox and share them.

From now on, every `★ Insight` I generate gets appended to that file automatically. What's next?

## Key Actions

- - **Write**: /Users/sa/rh.REDACTED.md
- - **Read**: /Users/sa/.claude/projects/-Users-sa-rh-1/memory/MEMORY.md
- - **Edit**: /Users/sa/.claude/projects/-Users-sa-rh-1/memory/MEMORY.md
