## Prompt

Show current usage stats, billing stats, API stats, show any active limits

## Summary

I don't have direct access to your Anthropic billing dashboard or API usage metrics. Here's how to check each:

**Claude Code CLI Usage**
- Run `/usage` in Claude Code to see your current session token usage

**Anthropic API / Console Stats**
- Visit **https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage** for API usage and billing
- Visit **https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits** for rate limits and tier info
- Visit **https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing** for billing details

**Claude Pro/Max Subscription**
- Visit **https://claude.ai/settings** for subscription plan details

Would you like me to check anything locally, such as your Claude Code configuration or session-level stats?
