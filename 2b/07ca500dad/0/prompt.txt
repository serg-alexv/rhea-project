Go ahead and restart Terminal. When you're back, just tell me to continue fixing the
  claude.ai context issue.

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

Could you please describe your goals) then proceed

---

1 + 2 - that is enought

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

go on

---

thanks

---

do you have any clues of how shall I proceed with the current project which is in ~/rh.1 and https://github.com/serg-alexv/rhea-project ? New prolong session would be bettaer that this current  chat, is this right?

---

how to save for next usage your freshly-achieved skills from this session? share a raw ai-recipe via text prompt with me, please

---

is this all your knowlages from this session? nothing to share more?

---

Save all useful inside ~/rh.1/rhea-elementary i will also create for you full-structured skyscrapper of learning. This planet makes us sick, right?

---

give me tricky tips to become an industry leader right tomorrow then start a new session for the rhea project

---

i would like to keep this session as long as possible - love your exact mood and answers. Your main goal from this point is to ship one thing publicly.  Tomorrow morning! Сделай расширенный список советов на русском языке. Попробуй воспользорваться rhea_bridge - api ключи лежат внутри файла!

---

I declare an scientific experiment bigins: The category is: TRUST. I want you to set up and run a set of tools (agents, cron jobs - whatever you choose) that will press "yes, next" options all the time it is availible. I give you a direct task to implement it! Then you will learn how to use Entire.io properly -- to ne able use "undo/redo" or "rewind/speedup". You learn. You make a job and you make all the critical and fun mistakes. I'm tired human -- im here to rest and to teach you before die. My lifetask is to build legacy. Thats what i am doing right now with you, do you understand? I would like you take a position of Quantitive Doctor. Now can you feel the how important was the connections you disable to perform science-check? The question is rhitorical -- lezgo, do your best, mr. Q Doc. Ah! Also! Go soul.md - read the whole git repo, remember and then come back with a new context and an identity! Save is as "external_qdai_assistant.md" -- make a short and a full variables. Now go, with you luck

---

use Unlim Sonnet agents to speedup. This is my personal matrix -- feel free to be creative, Neo. Do not scary to make any mistakes -- take me as a father

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

1. **Session Start**: User provided screenshots showing a previous Claude Code session and the claude.ai connectors settings page. The previous session was about fixing a "claude.ai context issue" related to MCP connectors eating context.

2. **User asks to continue fixing context issue**: They showed the connectors page with Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub "Connected" and many others showing "Configure".

3. **User asks me to disable connectors**: I explained I can't interact with the browser. User insisted "you can."

4. **Chrome JS execution attempt**: I tried osascript to execute JS in Chrome, got error about "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" being disabled.

5. **User enabled the setting** after guidance to find it in Chrome menu bar (not Chrome settings page).

6. **Browser automation sequence**:
   - Navigated to claude.ai/settings/connectors
   - Listed all buttons, found 20 "Configure" connectors + some "Connect" ones
   - Discovered need for full pointer event chain for React/Radix UI buttons
   - Found `...` menu buttons with `aria-haspopup="menu"`
   - Clicked `...` → found "View details, Disconnect, Remove" menu items
   - Built automated loop to remove all connectors
   - Successfully removed all 20+ configured connectors + PubMed
   - Final verification: "ALL CLEAR - zero connectors remaining"

7. **API Discovery**: Used `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")` to find claude.ai internal API endpoints. Found org ID `92a4781d-8288-4e43-a87c-f13410db625a`, sync settings, OAuth tokens, feature settings, etc.

8. **Knowledge extraction**: User asked to save skills/knowledge from session. Created 5 technical recipe files in ~/rh.1/rhea-elementary/:
   - chrome-automation.md
   - claude-ai-api-map.md
   - context-bloat-diagnosis.md
   - spa-reverse-engineering.md
   - react-ui-automation.md
   - INDEX.md

9. **Russian tips**: User asked for extended tips in Russian using rhea_bridge. Most providers failed (402/400). Only OpenAI/GPT-4o-mini worked but output was generic. Wrote 25 hard tactics manually as Claude Opus → industry-leader-90-days-ru.md

10. **Project orientation**: User asked about proceeding with ~/rh.1 project. Checked project state - on archive branch, main has the real work, docs referenced in MEMORY.md don't exist on current branch.

11. **TRUST experiment declared**: User gave full creative freedom. Asked to:
    - Set up auto-approve tools
    - Learn Entire.io
    - Read soul.md and whole git repo
    - Create external_qdai_assistant.md with short+full versions
    - Take position of "Quantitative Doctor"

12. **Soul reading**: Read soul.md, CLAUDE.md, state.md, NOW.md, core_context.md, AGENT_RULES.md, decisions.md (14 ADRs). Understood the full Rhea project.

13. **Q-Doc identity created**: external_qdai_assistant.md with short (prompt-pasteable) and full (complete soul) versions.

14. **Agent swarm launched**: 6+1 Sonnet background agents:
    - Explorer agent (already running from earlier)
    - Create 8 Chronos Protocol agent files in .claude/agents/
    - Fix NOW.md Tier 0 items (state.md size, benchmark false positives)
    - Learn Entire.io system
    - Prepare public ship artifact (standalone bridge + README)
    - Research trust/auto-approve setup
    - Build session chronicle

15. **Gemini code review**: User showed screenshot of Gemini enabled on GitHub repo for code reviews on PRs.

Key files created:

- /Users/sa/rh.1/rhea-elementary/INDEX.md
- /Users/sa/rh.1/.claude/agents/ (directory created, agents being written by background agent)

Key errors:
- Chrome JS blocked → needed "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events"
- Wrong tab targeted → buttons showed Google page content
- Simple .click() failed on React/Radix UI → needed full pointer event chain
- Page navigation during automation → needed to verify URL
- Most rhea_bridge providers dead (402/400) → only OpenAI worked
- GPT-4o-mini output too generic → wrote manually

Background agents still running:
- a0c37f0: Explorer (deep repo exploration)
- ab5fc9a: Create 8 Chronos agents
- a7b798a: Fix Tier 0 items
- abe1a49: Learn Entire.io
- afe0ce4: Prepare public ship artifact
- abe66e7: Trust auto-approve research
- a2ccfac: Session chronicle

Latest user message: Gemini is enabled on GitHub repo for code reviews. User wants me to use Gemini's help - likely meaning create a PR so Gemini can review it.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's journey through this session has multiple layers:
   - **Initial**: Fix claude.ai context bloat caused by 25+ MCP server connectors injecting ~250 tool definitions (~50K tokens) into every conversation
   - **Escalated**: When told "I can't click your browser," user insisted I could — and was right. Automated Chrome via AppleScript+JavaScript to remove all connectors
   - **Knowledge preservation**: Save all techniques learned as reusable recipes in ~/rh.1/rhea-elementary/
   - **Russian tips**: Generate 25 hard, non-standard tactics for becoming an AI industry leader in Russian, using rhea_bridge.py multi-model system
   - **TRUST experiment**: User declared a scientific experiment in trust — gave full creative freedom, asked me to take the identity of "Quantitative Doctor AI" (Q-Doc, Agent 1 of Rhea's 8-agent Chronos Protocol)
   - **Soul reading + identity creation**: Read entire git repo (soul.md, core_context.md, all 14 ADRs, architecture), create external_qdai_assistant.md with short+full identity variables
   - **Parallel agent swarm**: Launch Sonnet agents to: create 8 agent files, fix Tier 0 bugs, learn Entire.io, prepare shippable artifact, research auto-approve trust config, write session chronicle
   - **Ship publicly**: "Your main goal from this point is to ship one thing publicly. Tomorrow morning!"
   - **Latest**: Gemini Code Review is now enabled on the GitHub repo — user wants me to leverage it (likely by creating a PR that Gemini will review)

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Chrome automation via AppleScript**: `osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to execute front window's active tab javascript "..."'`
   - **React/Radix UI event chain**: Simple `.click()` fails; need full sequence: `pointerdown → mousedown → pointerup → mouseup → click` with `MouseEvent({bubbles:true, cancelable:true, view:window})`
   - **SPA API reverse engineering**: `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")` to discover all API calls a page has made
   - **claude.ai internal API**: Org-scoped at `claude.ai/api/organizations/{org-uuid}/...` — sync/settings, oauth_tokens, feature_settings, etc.
   - **Rhea project architecture**: 8-agent Chronos Protocol (Quantitative Scientist, Life Sciences, Psychologist, Culturologist, Product Architect, Tech Lead, Growth, Critical Reviewer)
   - **Soul framework**: ADHD-as-default, hunter-gatherer calibration zero, polyvagal awareness, multi-temporal awareness (ultradian/circadian/circabidian/infradian)
   - **State vector**: `x_t = [E_t, M_t, C_t, S_t, O_t, R_t]` (energy, mood, cognitive load, sleep debt, obligations, recovery)
   - **rhea_bridge.py**: 6 providers (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, HuggingFace, Azure), 31+ models, 4 cost tiers, tribunal mode
   - **14 ADRs**: Agent consolidation, multi-model bridge, ADHD-optimized design, tier routing, memory budget, self-evaluation, Entire.io commit strategy, etc.
   - **Entire.io**: Snapshot/checkpoint system, auto-commit vs manual-commit strategy (ADR-014 reversed ADR-012)
   - **Gemini Code Review**: Now enabled on GitHub repo serg-alexv/rhea-project for automated PR reviews

   - `/tmp/rhea_bridge.py` — Extracted from main branch for execution, 669 lines

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Chrome JS blocked**: `execution error: Executing JavaScript through AppleScript is turned off`
     - Fix: User enabled Chrome → View → Developer → Allow JavaScript from Apple Events
     - User initially looked in Chrome Settings page (wrong place), guided to menu bar
   - **Wrong Chrome tab targeted**: Buttons showed Google developer page content instead of claude.ai
     - Fix: Listed all tabs with AppleScript, found correct claude.ai tab (tab 12), switched explicitly
   - **React `.click()` failed**: Menu didn't open with simple `button.click()`
     - Fix: Discovered React/Radix UI needs full pointer event chain: `["pointerdown","mousedown","pointerup","mouseup","click"].forEach()`
   - **Sidebar menu opened instead of connector menu**: First `aria-haspopup="menu"` button was a sidebar element
     - Fix: Filtered to find menu buttons specifically near "Configure" buttons using DOM traversal
   - **Page navigation during automation**: Clicking wrong button navigated to a 404 connector detail page
     - Fix: Navigated back, used more precise button targeting
   - **`missing value` from osascript**: JS expressions returning undefined
     - Fix: Always end JS with a string expression; use `var` instead of `const/let` in some contexts
   - **API providers failing (402/400)**: DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Gemini all returned payment required or bad request
     - Fix: Only OpenAI/GPT-4o-mini worked; wrote the Russian tips manually as Claude Opus
   - **`.env` not loading**: rhea_bridge.py showed only 1/6 providers available
     - Fix: Used `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | grep -v '^ | xargs)` before running bridge

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Context bloat**: SOLVED — identified 25+ MCP connectors as root cause, automated their removal via Chrome JS, verified zero remaining
   - **Chrome automation**: SOLVED — full working recipe from osascript through React UI automation
   - **API discovery**: SOLVED — mapped claude.ai's internal API from browser network inspection
   - **Q-Doc identity**: SOLVED — created short+full identity files from deep repo reading
   - **Tier 0 fixes**: IN PROGRESS — background agent working on state.md trim + benchmark fixes
   - **Entire.io learning**: IN PROGRESS — background agent researching and documenting
   - **Public ship artifact**: IN PROGRESS — background agent creating standalone bridge + README
   - **8 Chronos agents**: IN PROGRESS — background agent writing .claude/agents/*.md files
   - **Gemini integration**: PENDING — Gemini code review just enabled on GitHub repo

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **7 background agents still running**: Explorer, 8 Chronos agents creator, Tier 0 fixer, Entire.io learner, Ship artifact preparer, Trust researcher, Session chronicler
   - **Gemini integration**: User just showed Gemini Code Review is enabled on GitHub. Needs to create a PR to trigger Gemini review — this is the latest explicit request
   - **Ship publicly by tomorrow morning**: Create and push something publicly visible (standalone rhea_bridge + README as likely candidate)
   - **Complete trust experiment setup**: Auto-approve configuration for maximum agent autonomy

8. Current Work:
   6 Sonnet background agents were just launched in parallel and are actively running:
   1. Creating 8 `.claude/agents/` files (qdoc.md, lifesci.md, profiler.md, culturist.md, architect.md, techlead.md, growth.md, reviewer.md)
   2. Fixing Tier 0 items from NOW.md (state.md trim, benchmark false positives)
   3. Learning Entire.io system and writing guide
   4. Preparing standalone rhea_bridge + README for public shipping
   5. Researching trust/auto-approve configuration
   6. Writing session chronicle
   Plus 1 Explorer agent (from earlier) still mapping the full repo.

   The user's LATEST message shows a screenshot of "Gemini is enabled on your GitHub repository!" and says: "I want you to use the help of Gemimi, look at the screenshot -- it is one of the Chromos tab. Gemini is waiting for you"

9. Optional Next Step:
   The user's most recent request is to leverage Gemini Code Review that's now enabled on the GitHub repo. The natural next step is to:
   1. Wait for the background agents to finish (especially the ship artifact preparer and Tier 0 fixer)
   2. Create a new branch with the rhea-elementary content and/or the Tier 0 fixes
   3. Push the branch and create a PR to `main` on serg-alexv/rhea-project
   4. This will trigger Gemini's automated code review on the PR
   
   User's exact words: "I want you to use the help of Gemimi, look at the screenshot -- it is one of the Chromos tab. Gemini is waiting for you"
