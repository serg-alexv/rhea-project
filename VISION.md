# Vision

Rhea rebuilds your daily defaults from first principles.

Not a habit tracker. Not a wellness app. A system that replaces the unchosen automatisms of modern life with a consciously designed environment — personalized to your neurobiology, grounded in what 16+ civilizations discovered independently, and validated against what hunter-gatherer communities still do naturally.

## The problem

Modern defaults are optimized for consumption, not function. Wake to alarm → screen → caffeine → sedentary → artificial light → delayed sleep → repeat. This loop degrades autonomic regulation, circadian alignment, and executive function. People with ADHD hit the wall first, but everyone is affected.

The common fix — willpower-based habit tracking — fails precisely for those who need it most. Executive dysfunction means the tool that requires executive function is the wrong tool.

## The approach

1. **Observe, don't interrogate.** Profile built from HealthKit sensors and device signals. Zero questionnaires.
2. **Body before mind.** Morning = sensory contact, light exposure, movement. Not decisions.
3. **Minimum effective dose.** Control theory applied to daily rhythms — smallest intervention, largest shift.
4. **Cultural roots.** Every recommendation traces to a source civilization and a biological mechanism. No "productivity guru" advice.
5. **Offline-first.** Your data stays on your device. The system works without internet.

## The tech

Multi-model AI bridge (6 providers, 31+ models) for deep analysis. On-device CoreML for daily predictions. SwiftData for local persistence. HealthKit for biometric input. No cloud dependency in the core loop.

## Who this is for

Anyone whose daily defaults don't serve them. Built ADHD-first — if it works for executive dysfunction, it works for everyone.
