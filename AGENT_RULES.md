# Agent Rules (Rhea)\n\n## Working style\n- Keep diffs small and reviewable.\n- Do not change unrelated files.\n- Prefer additive edits (new files) over refactors.\n- Never delete data/logs without explicit instruction.\n\n## Claude Code usage\n- Always show a plan before editing.\n- Always list files you will touch.\n- After changes: show summary + run checks.\n\n## Repo invariants\n- docs/state.md stays <= 2KB.\n- docs/* are the canonical specs.\n- src/* contains executable code.\n
