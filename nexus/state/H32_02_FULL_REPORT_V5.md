## 1. Executive Summary: The Heme-Auxotrophic Reality
This report supersedes all previous versions. Following a 5-model multi-node audit, the "Heme-dependent aerobe" hypothesis has been refined. H32-02 Ksu is certified as a **Heme-Auxotrophic Facultative Respirer.**

**The Core Correction:**
While the metabolic "Engine" (Ndh/MQ/CydAB) is genomically present, it is **intrinsically locked.** Because the genome lacks the `hemA-H` biosynthesis pathway, the terminal oxidase (Cytochrome bd) cannot assemble. Without exogenous supplementation, the organism remains an **obligate fermenter.**

## 2. Certified Metabolic Map (Post-Surgery)

### 2.1 The "Locked" Respiratory Circuit
| Component | Locus | Verified Identity | Operational Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electron Entry (NDH)** | `RS08265` | NADH Dehydrogenase II | **ACTIVE** (Generic label retracted) |
| **Electron Carrier (MQ)** | `RS06430` | Menaquinone (MenA) | **ACTIVE** (Pathway Complete) |
| **Terminal Oxidase** | `RS05050-65` | Cytochrome bd | **INACTIVE** (Requires Heme) |

### 2.2 The Topological Singularity: HEME
The failure of the V4 model was "Success-Blindness." We saw the genes and assumed the phenotype. 
- **Singularity:** Zero genomic potential for Heme synthesis.
- **Surgery:** Recategorize from "Aerobe" to "Auxotroph."

## 3. Industrial Actuation Vector
H32-02 remains a high-value asset, but its application requires a **Bimodal Substrate Strategy**:
1.  **Standard Mode:** Heterofermentative lactic acid production.
2.  **Respiration Mode:** High-biomass aerobic growth **ONLY** when supplemented with Hemin/Heme-rich substrates.
