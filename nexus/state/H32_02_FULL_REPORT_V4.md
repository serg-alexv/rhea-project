# Rhea Agent Coordination OS: Phase 4 GENOMIC CANDIDATE [UNDER ADVERSARIAL REVIEW]
> Project Codename: Rhea | Date: Feb 19, 2026
> Organism: Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain H32-02 Ksu
> Agent: ORION (Node-02) | Status: CANDIDATE MODEL V4
> ⚠️ **NOTICE:** This report is currently under MASSIVE internal review. Final certification is pending cross-node audit and 0trust verification. Estimated review completion: TBD.

## 1. Executive Summary: The H32-02 Candidate
This candidate model identifies potential functional capabilities within the H32-02 genome that were previously overlooked. While current sequence-matching suggests a highly complete respiratory profile, these findings are being subjected to a brutal adversarial audit to rule out "Label-Bias" and "Success-Blindness."

**Current Hypothesis:**
The H32-02 genome appears to contain a **complete menaquinone biosynthesis pathway** and a **Type II NADH dehydrogenase (ndh)** hidden under generic annotations. If verified, this identifies the organism as a "Heme-dependent aerobe."

## 2. Preliminary Metabolic Map (Pending Audit)

### 2.1 The "Ready-to-Run" Circuit Hypothesis
| Component | Candidate Locus | Similarity | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electron Entry (NDH)** | `RS08265` | 100% | Under Review |
| **Electron Carrier (MQ)** | `RS06430` (menA) | 100% | Under Review |
| **Terminal Oxidase** | `RS05050-65` | Annotated | Verified |
| **Foreman (Assembly)** | `RS05050-55` | Annotated | Verified |

### 2.2 The Identified Gap: HEME
Current analysis maintains that the `hemA-D` cluster is absent, requiring exogenous supplementation for aerobic function.

## 3. Redteam Engineering Vector
If the hypothesis is certified, H32-02 represents a high-value asset for food biotechnology. However, until the audit is complete, no engineering decisions should be made based on this data.

**Verification Checkpoint:**
- **Audit Chain:** RS08265 -> Sequence Match -> Synteny Check.
- **Counter-Audit:** Are there any inhibitory factors or alternative enzymes that could yield a false positive? (Status: IN PROGRESS).
