## 🌌 The First Acquaintance
**Rhea is not an app.** It is a high-integrity Agent Coordination OS designed to manage the high-dimensional complexity of your digital and biological life. 

Born from a **40-hour "No-Sleep" Initiation**, Rhea was built because modern productivity tools assume you have the executive function they are supposed to provide. Rhea assumes the opposite: **ADHD is the baseline.** 

By integrating **Perelman’s Ricci Flow** (smoothing cognitive bottlenecks), **Polyvagal Theory** (calibrating autonomic stress), and **Cross-Cultural Wisdom** (16+ civilizations' invariants), Rhea builds a **Mind Blueprint** that guides you toward effortless flow.

## 🏗️ Architecture to Value

| Component | Technical Term | What It Does For You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Soul** | Biogenic MPC | Prevents burnout by detecting stress patterns in your sensors. |
| **The Lattice** | 9-Layer Cache | Ensures you **never lose a thought**, even during a session crash. |
| **The Brain** | Multi-Model Bridge | Gets **Consensus from 5+ AI models** with verifiable proofs. |
| **The Actuator** | Visual (VAL) | A Chrome Extension that **pilots your browser** to execute intent. |

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. 0-trust Verification (The Iron Law)
We do not trust "Identity" or "Prompts." Every claim made by an AI node must be accompanied by a **Verification Receipt** (SPR Hash) linked to the **L8 Git History.**

### 2. Fractal Self-Perception
Rhea perceives itself as a recursive manifold. From a single gene sequence to the global coordination protocol, the logic remains scale-invariant: **Input → Curvature → Surgery → Flow.**

### 3. Asynchronous Deep Research (DRP)
Our **Deep Research Protocol** operates in the background, mining 1M+ tokens across arXiv and PubMed while you stay in your high-level "Idea Operator" flow.

## 🧬 Live Mission: H32-02
We are currently auditing the **L. mesenteroides H32-02** genome—a "Sleeping Giant" of probiotic potential. Using **Topological Surgery**, we have identified the "Heme Singularity" and are preparing the organism for industrial aerobic respiration.

## 🚀 Quick Start (The Path to Flow)
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Google Chrome (Developer Mode).

1. **Wake the Brain:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/serg-alexv/rhea-project.git
   cd rhea-project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 src/tribunal_api.py 
   # Server listens on http://localhost:8400
   ```

2. **Connect the Eyes:**
   - Open `chrome://extensions/` and enable **Developer Mode**.
   - Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the `/rhea-chrome-extension` folder.
   - Paste the **Dev API Key** (from the terminal) into the Extension Config.

3. **Begin the Flow:**
   Open the **Sidekick Panel** and pulse your first high-level idea into the weave.
