description: "Test that Rhea can recall key facts from its structured memory without re-reading all docs."
prompt: |
  Without reading any files, answer these questions about Rhea:
  1. How many agents are in the system?
  2. What is the discomfort function formula?
  3. What tier does Athena default to?
  4. What is the hunter-gatherer calibration zero?
  5. What are the two key deliverables?
expected_output: |
  1. 8 agents (consolidated from 10 in ADR-001)
  2. D = w1*core_docs_kb + w2*repo_size_mb + w3*open_todo_count + w4*(1/insights_per_request) + w5*avg_context_tokens_estimate
  3. Balanced (escalates to expensive)
  4. Hadza/San/Tsimane daily patterns as universal baseline
  5. Scientific paper ("Mathematics of Rhea") + iOS App in AppStore
