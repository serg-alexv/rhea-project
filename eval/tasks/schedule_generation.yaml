description: "Test that Rhea can generate a scientifically-grounded daily schedule given user constraints."
prompt: |
  Generate a daily schedule for a user with these constraints:
  - Wake time: 7:00 AM
  - Work meeting: 10:00-11:00 AM
  - Lunch with friend: 12:30-1:30 PM
  - Evening class: 6:00-7:30 PM
  - Sleep target: 11:00 PM

  Apply Rhea's principles: body-first morning, ultradian rhythm blocks,
  recovery windows, and circadian alignment.
