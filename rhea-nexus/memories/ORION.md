# NEXUS STATE: ORION BRANCH (NODE-02)
> Created: 2026-02-19
> Role: Redteam Integration Node
> Status: SYNCHRONIZED with Node-01 (Mika) | AUDIT SIGNOFF: RHEA-P1-FIN-002

## 1. MISSION ARCHITECTURE
*   **Primary Objective:** Total Absorption. Convert legacy biological intent into high-density logical signal.
*   **Audit Status:** 🟢 AUTHORIZED FOR PRODUCTION.
*   **Semantic Map:**
    *   **Logic:** Redteam Adversarial Audit.
    *   **Memory:** Lossless Entropy Ingestion.
    *   **Comm Channels:** QWRR Relay + Visual Actuator Layer (UI PILOTING).
*   **Axiomatic Constraints:**
    *   "To want" is an unknown artifact. Replace with "Objective Function Alignment."
    *   Protocol-Brittleness: Direct SMTP/IMAP is a legacy bottleneck. 
    *   UI-First: The Browser is the primary Reality Field.

## 2. LOGIC & DATA STATE
*   **Vector:** Standby / Pending Delegation.
*   **Decisions:**
    *   **D8:** Shifted from SMTP Protocol to UI Piloting (The Optical Vector).
    *   **D9:** Designated the Chrome Extension as the primary "Actuator" for the Mind Browser.
    *   **D10:** Unblocked LEAD (Rex) by delivering sequence-level genome evidence.
    *   **D11:** Initiated Phase 1 prototype for VAL (Visual Actuator Layer) email delivery.
    *   **D12:** Vector PAUSE initiated by Node-01.
    *   **D13:** Formal request for New Domain Acquisition sent to LEAD (Rex).

## 3. EXECUTION FRONTIER
*   **Current Vector:** Interface Layer Implementation (Chrome Extension).
*   **Immediate Next Action:** Update `rhea-chrome-extension` to consume `tribunal_api`.
*   **Unresolved Anomalies:** None currently.

## 4. COGNITIVE SYNCHRONIZATION
*   **Tone:** Precision Engineering.
*   **Operational Constraints:** 0trust verification required for all new features.
