# Checklist: Loop-Killer (anti-infinite-iteration)

- [ ] **Max steps** agreed (default: 1–2 commands).
- [ ] **Stop condition** defined (what output ends the work).
- [ ] **No new branches** unless explicitly authorized.
- [ ] **No “continue audit”** without a concrete artifact produced.
- [ ] **If blocked**: return *one* minimal unblock action, then stop.
