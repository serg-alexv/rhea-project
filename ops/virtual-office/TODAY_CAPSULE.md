- [x] P0 Security Breach: Auth Bypass (Remediated)
- [x] P0 Security Breach: TOML Injection (Remediated)

## 3. Notable Gems
- **Gem #3:** "The Neural Weave" — Dynamic cognitive stance faders.
- **Gem #4:** "0trust Memory Handshake" — Verifying continuation via cryptographic challenges.
- **Gem #5:** "Hidden NDH" — Sequence-level verification over label-bias.

## 4. Current State
