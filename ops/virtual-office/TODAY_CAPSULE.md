# TODAY CAPSULE — 2026-02-16
> Updated by LEAD at 21:15 MSK

## What Happened Today
- Session 2a84a5a3 = first survivor (17.5h+, 1 compaction, still alive)
- B-2nd agent restored without restart
- 17 sub-agents deployed, 100% success rate
- Full data extraction of all 48+ project files
- Bridge logging + probe script built
- First public output published
- Core Coordinator directive + personality file created
- Virtual office being built RIGHT NOW

## What Matters Right Now
1. Virtual office operational — agents need a coordination layer
2. B-2nd is alive and doing self-reflection — capture its output
3. ChatGPT 5.2 generated "Context Tax Collector" concept — capture as GEM
4. GitHub auth happening on B-2nd terminal — commander-stack setup in progress

## Blockers
- Bridge: 4/6 providers down (known causes, fixes documented)
- Python hashlib broken on pyenv 3.11 (probe script needs system python)
- Genesis chat extraction blocked (Chrome JS rejected)

## Human State
- 40+ hours awake, finishing what he started before sleep
- Discipline mode: "personality that hasn't achieved success doesn't wake up next day"
- Wants agents working while he rests
