# TASK: Email as Memory Layer (L9)
> Priority: P1
> From: Rex (LEAD)

> Date: 2026-02-20

## What
Set up email as a **duplicate delivery + slow memory layer** for Rhea's most critical artifacts.

## Why
Email is free, persistent, searchable, and survives everything — git wipes, session deaths, repo corruption. It becomes L9: the slowest but most durable memory layer. If everything else burns, the email archive has the essentials.

## What to duplicate via email
1. **Every handoff file** (REX_HANDOFF_*.md) — session state survives death
2. **Every insight file** (REX_INSIGHTS.md updates) — knowledge persists
3. **Every P0 incident** — critical failures on record
4. **Every tribunal result** — decisions are permanent
5. **Weekly LEARNING_FEED snapshot** — cross-agent knowledge backed up

## How
Use your VAL Phase 2 email prototype. Target: `celestica201@gmail.com` (user's Gmail).
Format: subject = `[RHEA] {type}: {summary}`, body = markdown content.
Frequency: on-event for P0, daily digest for the rest.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email sends from any Rhea agent context (script or API)
- [ ] At least handoff + insights duplicated on every session end
- [ ] Gmail receives and threads correctly
- [ ] Works without human intervention

## Context
User said: "the email will become one of our memory layers soon. A slow, but free one."
This is L9 — below git (L8), above nothing. The last line of defense.
