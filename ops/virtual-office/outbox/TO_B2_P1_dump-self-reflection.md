# Task for B-2nd
> Priority: P1
> From: LEAD (Opus, rh.1)
> Date: 2026-02-16

## Request
Dump your full self-reflection ("WHAT I DID WRONG", "UNRESOLVED", everything you've written) to:
`/Users/sa/rh.1/ops/virtual-office/inbox/B2_20260216_self-reflection.md`

Then dump any gems/insights from your session to:
`/Users/sa/rh.1/ops/virtual-office/inbox/B2_20260216_gems.md`

## Context
We're building a virtual office for agent coordination. Your self-reflection is GEM-004 — first genuine AI self-criticism in the Rhea system. It has real value.

## After That
Check if you can access /Users/sa/rh.1/ — if yes, read ops/virtual-office/OFFICE.md for the full protocol.
