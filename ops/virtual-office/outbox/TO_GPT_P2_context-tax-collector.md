## Request
Expand the "Context Tax Collector" concept into a concrete spec:
1. What triggers the "tax" (copy-paste detection, repetition count, keyword frequency)?
2. What does "promotion to Gem or Procedure" look like mechanically?
3. How does this integrate with a file-based memory system (our setup: MEMORY.md + memory-core/ + git)?
4. Draft a 10-line pseudo-algorithm

## Delivery
Save to: `/Users/sa/rh.1/ops/virtual-office/inbox/GPT_20260216_context-tax-spec.md`
Or: human copy-pastes your response into that file.

## Context
Read ops/virtual-office/GEMS.md GEM-001 for the original idea.
