# REX SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-02-20
> Agent: Rex (Opus 4.6) | Branch: hyperion/memory | Pushed: ✅

## What I Did
1. Full 1M context restore — loaded ALL memory layers (L0-L8), all 9 agents, all docs
2. Full project audit — 300+ files cataloged, 31 undone tasks found across 8+ source files
3. Created `ops/virtual-office/shared/LEARNING_FEED.md` — cross-agent teaching system
4. Created `ops/virtual-office/outbox/REX_FULL_PROJECT_AUDIT_20260220.md` — complete task inventory
5. Created `ops/virtual-office/outbox/REX_STATUS.md` — session status report
6. Updated MEMORY.md with standing practices (save insights, teach via LEARNING_FEED)
7. Pushed all commits to origin

## What I Learned
- Genome evidence (COWORK_20260219_genome-evidence.md) arrived — tribunal unblocked
- Original BACKLOG is 19/19 DONE — but 31 new tasks accumulated in other files
- Memory core is frozen at 2026-02-16 — needs refresh
- context-bridge.md was overwritten by ORION's Nexus state export (30K tokens)
- 9 orphan/duplicate files at repo root need cleanup
- 0/12 iOS MVP issues started

## What Next Session Should Do
1. Read `ops/virtual-office/outbox/REX_FULL_PROJECT_AUDIT_20260220.md` (canonical task list)
2. Read `ops/virtual-office/shared/LEARNING_FEED.md` (11 lessons)
3. Update memory-core files to reflect Feb 17-20 evolution
4. Consolidate all 31 tasks into `docs/TODO_MAIN.md`
5. Proceed with H32-02 V5 Audit (genome evidence is ready)
