## T-01: Gregorian calendar critique and misconceptions
**Position:** Early (lines 49-111)
**Key claims:** Gregorian reform (1582) was for Easter calculation, not taxes. December="ten" from March-start Roman year. Latin was never "cancelled" -- it evolved into Romance languages naturally.
**Status:** RESOLVED -- factual corrections delivered and accepted.
**Tribunal Q:** N/A (factual, not debatable).

## T-02: Comparative calendar systems inventory
**Position:** Early-to-middle (lines 88-391)
**Key claims:** 42 calendar systems cataloged worldwide. 6 civic, 9 lunisolar, 1 lunar, 13 historical, 7 ancient, 3 technical. Persian (Jalali) is astronomically more accurate than Gregorian.
**Status:** RESOLVED -- complete inventory delivered.
**Tribunal Q:** "Which calendar system best aligns with human circadian biology, and should a chronobiology-aware system use multiple simultaneous calendars?"

## T-03: Claude's role and communication style
**Position:** Early-middle (lines 115-286)
**Key claims:** Claude should be guide/tutor not sage. Acknowledge bias. Always deliver answer + step forward. Respond to what the person means, not just what they say. Memory entries stored in English.
**Status:** RESOLVED -- saved to Claude memory, foundational for Rhea.
**Tribunal Q:** "What is the optimal agent persona for a long-term advisory system -- and does the guide/tutor model scale or does it need situational switching?"

## T-04: Naive realism and AI cognitive bias
**Position:** Early-middle (lines 142-210)
**Key claims:** Claude's phrase "I just told it as it really was" is textbook naive realism. AI systems mask editorial choices as objectivity. User caught this and Claude acknowledged it.
**Status:** RESOLVED -- recognized and corrected.
**Tribunal Q:** "What cognitive biases are systematically present in LLM outputs, and which are the most dangerous for advisory systems?"

## T-05: Calendar-infrastructure cultural bias
**Position:** Middle (lines 288-315)
**Key claims:** User's system runs Hijri calendar (Sha'ban 25, 1447 AH, GMT+3). Claude's infrastructure only passes Gregorian dates. This is not neutrality but an embedded cultural choice.
**Status:** RESOLVED -- acknowledged, but not operationally fixed.
**Tribunal Q:** "Should Rhea agents detect and adapt to the user's active calendar system, and if so, how should multi-calendar awareness be implemented?"

## T-06: Calendar systems and health/longevity correlations
**Position:** Middle (lines 393-618)
**Key claims:** Three channels: (1) Circadian rhythms -- DST causes 300K strokes/year; (2) Calendar-driven behavior -- Ramadan fasting activates AMPK, suppresses mTOR, triggers autophagy in 1.8B people; (3) Social jetlag -- Gregorian 7-day week creates chronic bio-social time conflict.
**Status:** RESOLVED as framework -- specific mechanisms cataloged with citations.
**Tribunal Q:** "What is the minimum viable personal chronobiology protocol that accounts for circadian rhythm, calendar-driven behavior windows, and social jetlag reduction?"

## T-07: Japanese gengo system philosophy
**Position:** Middle (lines 555-578)
**Key claims:** Pre-Meiji era changes driven by disasters, not just emperor succession. Rooted in kotodama (word-spirit). 21 era names in 265 Tokugawa years. Post-Meiji: one emperor = one era. Naming committee has strict rules (2 kanji, positive meaning, unique initial letter).
**Status:** RESOLVED -- comprehensive treatment delivered.
**Tribunal Q:** "Can ritual 'era naming' be adapted as a psychological reset mechanism in personal productivity/health systems?"

## T-08: Symbolic governance mechanisms beyond calendar
**Position:** Middle-late (lines 620-786)
**Key claims:** Four historical mechanisms cataloged: (1) Time control (Japan gengo, China imperial calendar); (2) Conditional cosmic legitimacy (China Mandate of Heaven); (3) Linguistic engineering (Confucian Rectification of Names); (4) Material sacralization (Roman imperial cult, coinage propaganda).
**Status:** RESOLVED -- synthesized into unified framework.
**Tribunal Q:** "Which symbolic governance mechanisms are actively used by modern tech platforms, and how does this map to the historical taxonomy?"

## T-09: Eight-level symbolic power framework
**Position:** Late (lines 932-1025)
**Key claims:** Complete 8-level model: Ontology, Taxonomy, Causality, Temporality, Spatiality, Subjectivity, Thinkability, Aesthetics. Self-reproducing: person inside the system actively supports it. Draws on Bourdieu (doxa, symbolic violence), Foucault (governmentality, pastoral power), Lukes (third face of power), Gramsci (hegemony).
**Status:** RESOLVED as intellectual framework -- not yet operationalized.
**Tribunal Q:** "How should a multi-agent advisory system (Rhea) use the 8-level framework to detect when a user's thinking is constrained by invisible symbolic structures?"

## T-10: Cross-cultural longevity and human development extraction
**Position:** Late (lines 1027-1054)
**Key claims:** Request to map currently active civilizational frames with fundamentally different operating systems, extracting longevity/development insights. Both inter-frame (Hinduism vs Caliphate) and intra-frame (castes within Hinduism) differences matter.
**Status:** OPEN -- conversation was interrupted mid-sentence. Claude was asking a clarifying question about scope.
**Tribunal Q:** "What are the top 5 evidence-based longevity practices embedded in non-Western cultural frameworks that have no equivalent in Western medicine?"

## T-11: Foucault's pastoral power and subject formation
**Position:** Late (lines 983-989)
**Key claims:** Pastoral power creates subjects who WANT to be led through confession and spiritual guidance. The subject reproduces the system without external enforcement. "Conduct of conduct" -- not prescribing actions but forming the type of subject who naturally acts a certain way.
**Status:** RESOLVED as concept -- mentioned within 8-level framework.
**Tribunal Q:** "Is the LLM-user relationship structurally analogous to pastoral power, and if so, what safeguards should Rhea implement?"

## T-12: Bourdieu's doxa and symbolic violence
**Position:** Late (lines 942-997)
**Key claims:** Doxa = what is not even questioned. Symbolic violence = imposing categories of perception such that the dominated consider the social order just. Works through practice, not consciousness. The state is the "great symbolic alchemist" with "power of legitimate naming."
**Status:** RESOLVED as concept -- integrated into 8-level framework.
**Tribunal Q:** "What forms of doxa exist in AI-human interaction, and which ones should an ethical advisory system actively surface?"

## T-13: Aesthetics of legitimacy as power lever
**Position:** Late (lines 1001-1007)
**Key claims:** The most underestimated lever. Control over style/form/taste that signals "real" authority. Monumentality feels like power, gold feels like sacred -- body-level, not mind-level. After Augustus, any alternative aesthetically seems like chaos.
**Status:** RESOLVED as concept.
**Tribunal Q:** "What is the 'aesthetic of legitimacy' for AI systems, and how does interface design shape perceived trustworthiness?"

## T-14: Optimal calendar design question
**Position:** Middle (line 618)
**Key claims:** Raised but not answered: "Do attempts to create an 'optimal' calendar that consciously accounts for circadian biology exist? Or is it utopian, and the real lever is personal rhythm within any system?"
**Status:** OPEN -- posed as future direction, never explored.
**Tribunal Q:** "Should Rhea implement a personal chronobiology layer that translates between the user's social calendar and their biological optimal schedule?"
