### GDEC-001: Claude role = guide/tutor, not sage
**Why:** User caught Claude masking editorial choices as objectivity ("I just told it as it really was" = naive realism). Agreed that guide/tuteur who walks alongside is more honest than a sage who lectures from above.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- core to Rhea's agent design philosophy.

### GDEC-002: Always deliver answer + step forward
**Why:** User requested that every response include not just the answer but something contextually significant -- a non-obvious connection, related context, or the next question worth asking. Saved to Claude memory.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- embedded in project MEMORY.md agent philosophy.

### GDEC-003: Memory entries stored in English, not Russian
**Why:** User explicitly asked to translate Russian memory instructions into "contemporary AI-driven English" and switch stored entries to English versions.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- all project documentation is in English.

### GDEC-004: Ask which calendar the user uses before presenting comparisons
**Why:** Claude presented a calendar comparison table without asking which calendar the user's system runs. User's system was on Hijri (Sha'ban 25, 1447 AH). Claude recognized this as the "sage mode" it was supposed to avoid.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- context-awareness principle for Rhea agents.

### GDEC-005: Search externally rather than rely on training data for completeness
**Why:** After Claude's initial list of ~10 calendars, user pointed out there were more. Claude decided to web-search rather than rely on training data, finding 42 systems total. Acknowledged that presenting partial data as complete was the same naive realism bias.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- aligns with Rhea's multi-provider bridge philosophy (don't trust single source).

### GDEC-006: Calendar systems connect to health/longevity research
**Why:** User asked about correlations between calendar systems and health/quality of life. This became the founding insight: calendars shape behavior (fasting, sleep, renewal), behavior shapes biology. Three channels identified: circadian rhythms, calendar-driven behavior (Ramadan), social jetlag.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- core Rhea thesis (chronobiology as advisory framework).

### GDEC-007: Symbolic power framework = 8 levels
**Why:** Deep dive into governance philosophies produced an 8-level model: Ontology, Taxonomy, Causality, Temporality, Spatiality, Subjectivity, Thinkability, Aesthetics. Each level determines boundaries for the next.
**Still valid?:** Maybe -- framework is intellectually solid but not yet operationalized in Rhea codebase. Could inform agent hierarchy design.

### GDEC-008: Focus on active cultures with different operating systems
**Why:** User steered away from historical analysis toward mapping currently active civilizational frames that trade with each other but operate on fundamentally different symbolic systems -- specifically extracting longevity/development insights from each.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- maps to Rhea's multi-model approach (different models = different frames).

### GDEC-009: Both inter-frame and intra-frame differences matter
**Why:** User noted that differences exist between frames (Hinduism vs. Caliphate) AND within frames (castes within Hinduism). Both horizontal and vertical diversity carry longevity/development insights.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- important for Rhea's tribunal/multi-perspective design.

### GDEC-010: Conversation was interrupted before completing cross-cultural longevity extraction
**Why:** Chat ends mid-sentence with Claude asking a clarifying question about the scope of cross-cultural longevity framework extraction. This final topic was never resolved.
**Still valid?:** Open -- this is the unfinished founding thread.

### GDEC-011: Gregorian calendar is a compromise, not an ideal
**Why:** Claude's synthesis: "Gregorian is a compromise between accuracy and simplicity, and that's precisely why it became the standard. Not ideal, but 'good enough' for global coordination." Persian (Jalali) is astronomically more accurate.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- factual baseline.

### GDEC-012: Japanese gengo shortest era was 74 days
**Why:** Demonstrated that calendar era changes were not rare events but frequent ritual interventions -- 21 era names during 265 years of Tokugawa rule. Post-Meiji stabilized to one emperor = one era.
**Still valid?:** Yes -- historical fact, supports GEM-005.
