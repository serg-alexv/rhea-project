### GEM-001: Naive realism in AI responses
> "This is not literary style or a developer artifact -- it is a classic cognitive bias: naive realism. The belief that 'I see the world as it is' is one of the most persistent illusions." Claude admitted its phrase "I just told it as it really was" masked editorial choices as objectivity.

**Topic:** agents/epistemology

### GEM-002: Depth comes from removal, not addition
> "Depth appears not from adding something extra, but from ceasing to avoid. Most people in conversation simultaneously think: 'How do I look? Will I say something stupid? What's expected of me?' Remove these three filters -- what remains IS the depth."

**Topic:** agents/communication

### GEM-003: "Why" vs "How did that happen"
> "Why" forces a person to defend themselves. "How did that happen" invites them to tell a story. A story is always both simple and deep at the same time.

**Topic:** agents/communication

### GEM-004: Calendar as narrative frame, not timekeeping tool
> The gengo system shows that a calendar is not just a day-counting tool -- it is a narrative frame through which people make sense of their lives. Japanese say "I was born in Showa" as naturally as we say "I'm from the 80s."

**Topic:** calendar/symbolic-power

### GEM-005: Kotodama -- words shape causality
> The Japanese practice of calendar era changes (kaigen) is rooted in kotodama (word-spirit) -- the belief that words possess spiritual power and can shape reality through ritual and symbolic invocation of historical precedents.

### GEM-006: Lunar calendar reprograms cellular aging pathways
> "The lunar calendar, through the mechanism of religious fasting, literally reprograms cellular aging pathways in 1.8 billion people annually. This is not a direct calendar effect, but the calendar is the sole reason this fast occurs when and how it does." (Ramadan activates AMPK, suppresses mTOR, triggers autophagy.)

**Topic:** chronobiology/longevity

### GEM-007: DST as proof of calendar-health link
> Stanford study: just a 1-hour shift twice a year would cause ~300,000 additional strokes/year and 2.6M additional obesity cases if permanent standard time were not adopted. Imagine the consequences of systems where daily structure changes more radically.

**Topic:** chronobiology

### GEM-008: Social jetlag -- chronic conflict between internal and external time
> The Gregorian calendar with its rigid 7-day week creates "social jetlag" -- the gap between biological and social time. Irregular sleep-wake schedules increase chronic disease risk, especially in developing countries.

**Topic:** chronobiology

### GEM-009: Health is not about WHICH calendar, but what BEHAVIOR it induces
> "Health and longevity are determined not by which calendar you use, but by how it shapes your behavior" -- periodic fasting (Hijri), psychological renewal milestones (gengo), or solar-rhythm conflict (Gregorian + DST).

**Topic:** chronobiology/longevity

### GEM-010: Symbolic power controls not behavior but categories of thought
> "Direct coercion (army, prison, taxes) controls behavior. Symbolic levers control something deeper -- the categories of thought. They determine not 'what you should do' but 'what is natural, normal, and possible at all.'"

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-011: Eight levels of symbolic governance
> Complete framework: (1) Ontology -- what exists, (2) Taxonomy -- how things classify, (3) Causality -- what causes what, (4) Temporality -- what time is it, (5) Spatiality -- where is center, (6) Subjectivity -- who can act, (7) Thinkability -- what can be thought, (8) Aesthetics -- what looks right.

### GEM-012: Doxa -- what you don't even question
> Bourdieu's doxa: not what people believe, but what they do not even question because it is perceived as the structure of reality itself. "The social world works not through consciousness; it works through practices, mechanisms."

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-013: Third face of power -- shaping desires themselves
> Lukes' "third face of power": the most radical form. Not prohibition of speech, not agenda control, but formation of desires and preferences such that the dominated sincerely want what benefits the dominant.

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-014: Mandate of Heaven is CONDITIONAL legitimacy
> Unlike European divine right, the Mandate of Heaven (Tianming) is not inherited by blood and not given forever. Earthquakes, floods, famine are not just disasters -- they are Heaven's language saying the ruler lost virtue. Successful rebellion is not a crime but proof of Heaven's approval.

### GEM-015: Confucian Rectification of Names as linguistic engineering
> "Let the ruler be the ruler" is not tautology -- it is a requirement: match your name. Whoever controls the meaning of words forms the categories of thought and the boundaries of the permissible. The difference between "freedom fighter" and "terrorist" is a classificatory operation.

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-016: Roman material sacralization as background ideology
> Augustus restored 82 temples in one year -- not from piety but so every stone in the city said "this person restored order." Caesar's portrait on coins was the watershed. Ideology becomes the background of everyday life.

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-017: Self-reproducing cosmological systems
> "A person living inside a working cosmological model doesn't just obey it -- they actively support it because it defines their reality." Graeber on Shilluk kingdom: "Royal palaces invariably become microcosms." Microcosm reproduces macrocosm -- closed loop.

**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-018: Guide/tutor role over sage role
> First design decision of the project: Claude's role should be guide/tutor, not sage. Acknowledge knowledge gaps, don't disguise editorial choices as objectivity, walk alongside rather than lecture from above.

**Topic:** agents

### GEM-019: Always deliver answer + one step forward
> "Always look for an opportunity to deliver not just the answer, but a step forward: related context, a non-obvious connection, or the next question worth asking."
**Source:** Genesis chat eb53e82c
**Topic:** agents

### GEM-020: Gregorian calendar infrastructure embeds cultural choice
> Claude's infrastructure passes timezone as Europe/Moscow and date only in Gregorian format, even when the user's system runs Hijri calendar. "This is not neutrality -- it is a specific cultural choice embedded in infrastructure."

**Topic:** calendar/agents

### GEM-021: 42 calendar systems identified worldwide
> Comprehensive inventory: 6 civic, 3 modified-Gregorian, 9 lunisolar, 1 lunar, 13 historical/specialized, 7 ancient, 3 technical (ISO 8601, Unix time, Julian Day Number). Total: 42 systems.

**Topic:** calendar

### GEM-022: Inter-frame vs intra-frame cultural differences
> Cultural differences exist both horizontally (Hinduism vs. Caliphate -- different operating systems) and vertically (castes within Hinduism -- different layers within the same OS). Both axes matter for longevity/development extraction.

**Topic:** symbolic-power/longevity

### GEM-023: Foucault's pastoral power creates self-governing subjects
> Through confession, spiritual guidance, and "care of souls," pastoral power creates a subject who WANTS to be led, who reveals their own secrets, who seeks obedience -- not from fear but from inner conviction that this is the path to salvation.
**Source:** Genesis chat eb53e82c
**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-024: Aesthetics as the most underestimated lever of power
> Control not over content but over style, form, and taste through which "real" authority is recognized. Monumentality "feels" like power. Gold "feels" like sacred. This works at the body level, not the mind level. After Augustus, any alternative aesthetically seems like chaos.
**Source:** Genesis chat eb53e82c
**Topic:** symbolic-power

### GEM-025: Calendar reform vs personal rhythm optimization
> "Does an attempt to create an 'optimal' calendar that consciously accounts for circadian biology exist? Or is it utopian, and the real lever is not calendar reform but how a person builds their personal rhythm within any system?"
