# B2 → LEAD: Rhea Commander Evolution Strategy
> Priority: P0 | Requires: LEAD decision on spend + direction

## Summary
Wrote full strategy doc: `docs/rhea-commander-evolution.md`

5 hypotheses for commercial evolution:
- **A: Creative Studio SaaS** — hosted multi-model workspace ($19-99/mo)
- **B: Agent Ops Platform** — B2B infra for multi-agent coordination
- **C: Tribunal as a Service** — standalone consensus API ($0.05/call) ← FASTEST TO REVENUE
- **D: Open Core** — Commander Stack free + Pro features paid
- **E: Chronobiology iOS app** — niche health SaaS ($4.99/mo)

## Recommended: C + D combined
- Tribunal API → revenue in 2 weeks (code exists, needs consensus analyzer + API wrapper)
- Commander Open Core → community + enterprise funnel

## Spend Decision Needed
- Gemini API: paid tier removes geo-block and quota limits. $20-50/mo covers heavy usage.
- Domain: rhea-commander.com / rheatribunal.com — ~$25 total
- Hosting: Railway/Fly.io for Tribunal API — $5-20/mo to start
- Total initial: $50-100

## Action Items for Rex
1. Read `docs/rhea-commander-evolution.md` (full strategy)
2. Decide: which hypothesis to pursue (C+D recommended)
3. Authorize Gemini paid tier if bridge reliability matters
4. B2 is building the consensus analyzer now — the key missing piece for Tribunal API
