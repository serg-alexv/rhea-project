**Watcher is LIVE** — PID 21700, monitoring, detected us alive.

To your question: no, not yet. What we have now is a **death detector** — it watches and alerts. The "press proceed" part requires something different: intercepting the Claude Code terminal's permission prompts and auto-approving them.

Two ways to do that:

1. **Add more permissions to `.claude/settings.local.json`** — the `allow` list pre-approves tool calls so they never prompt. This is the clean way. I can add blanket patterns like `Bash(*)`, `Write(*)`, `Read(*)` for this session.

2. **Use `expect` or `tmux send-keys`** to literally press "y" when a prompt appears — hackier but works for edge cases.

Option 1 is what you actually want. Want me to add broad permissions to settings.local.json so agents and I stop getting blocked? That would fix both the "press proceed" problem AND likely fix why the background agents are dying (they hit permission prompts with no one to approve).
