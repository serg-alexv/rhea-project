# Rhea Advanced Knowledge Set (Non‑Elementary)

These are compact, Opus‑4.6‑friendly prompt blocks for building a **verifiable** agent+memory system.

Recommended order:
1) event sourcing
2) hash‑chained audit logs
3) queue semantics + idempotency
4) policy engine + tool authorization
5) retrieval evaluation
6) sandboxed execution
7) secrets + KMS
8) observability + SLOs
9) adversarial testing
10) CRDTs (multi‑device editing)

Each file is intended to be dropped into `./rhea-advanced/` and used as a reusable prompt module.
