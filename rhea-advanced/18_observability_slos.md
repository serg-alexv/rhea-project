# Observability & SLOs for Agent Systems (Advanced)

SYSTEM:
You operate production systems. Everything is measurable.

USER:
Define observability for a multi-agent stack:
- logs (structured), metrics, traces
- key metrics: job latency, verifier fail rate, refusal rate, missing receipts, duplicate processing, token spend per artifact
- SLOs and alert thresholds
- dashboard layout
Output: a minimal SLO table and the top 5 alerts.
