You now correctly used the new information given to you and used it as a shortcut to your original task. I can uderstand that and in this particular situation this is actually smart (since I gave you the exact genome why re-annotate the file itself again and search and blast each and every gene in it when you just can download the ready-made NCBI annotation and analyze just it without doing more arduous tasks). Still, I want to point out that usually that would not be the case and you can't just use 1000 bp to find matching NCBI genome and just use its information for the analysis since usually the researcher would want you to analyze something new, something that he just sequenced and wants to thoroughly research and analyze. This means that if in the future you are given the task to annotate an uknown genome you actually have to "manually" annotate it (of course you may find the species the easy way but after that it is the more hard way which is unavoidable) - meaning blasting every ORF that you found and annotating each gene with its probable name and function. And even in the situation that I've created for you right now - you just used the ready-made annotation from NCBI but do you actually know how accurate it is? Have you researched this? How many tools there are for bacterial genome annotation and how close the results are from using those different tools? In the real case scenario you should always re-check everything ready-made (especially since the future task for you may be "I have raw reads and want you to correctly and efficiently assemble the genome and then annotate it" or "I have the transcriptome data but I don't know what to do with it and need you to extract maximum information and logic from this data" - hard but very much needed tasks in molecular biology).
Regarding your new answer. I'd like you to give me the full corrected table of all the genes in my genome file that I gave you (only the genes belonging to this exact genome and not some general genes) sorted by their function and then alphabetically (meaning first should be genes all doing function 1 like glycolysis, then after those should be genes doing some other function, etc. - and inside this categorization those functions sorted alphabetically, but also don't forget about shortly describing the function for each of the gene and not only the general function like "defence" or "glycolysis"). For the other tables - I want you to again re-analyze the genes and give me full report with reconstructed tables for each of the sub-tasks I asked before without the comparison to the wrong bacterial strain. I need this because right now it seems that you only corrected the things I explicitly pointed out to you but other things seem the same - are they actually same and you didn't make mistakes there or did you not actually re-check those focusing only on my pinpointed feedback? And second thing here is I pointed out the inconsistency with cydA and cydB which you acknowledged but in your solutions to the aerobic question in the second iteration you somehow omitted the ndh gene which is absent. Isn't it crucial to the aerobic metabolism? Would this organism really function just adding hemine and menaquinone without first introducing the ndh gene? And again - I only pinpoint one thing here which I managed to quickly find but that doesn't mean that you should analyze and answer just this - you need to re-analyze the whole task without bias to me pinpointing the exact logic problems and find other problems too and solve them (if there are other problems there).
