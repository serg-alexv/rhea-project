I have an assembled genome of some lactic acid bacteria species in the contigs.fasta format. I need you to define the specific organism this genome belongs to, then I need you to fully and correctly annotate this whole genome (you may use any online tool for this task) and based on this create a comprehensive table of all genes inside this genome (not only exact confident genes but also probable/possible based on their ORFs and similarities to existing genes in various organisms). This table must contain gene name, its function (20 words or less for this), its sequence exactly as it is in the genome. After this based on this table I need you to create several other tables: one table must contain all the genes needed for aerobic metabolism (both existing in the genome already and missing from it) of this bacteria species, the missing genes must be ranged from the most crucial to the least, and each gene must have its function stated in a separate column - then after this table I need a comprehensive textual explanation on what genes should be added to increase/restore aerobic metabolism in this species with a few variations (e.g., one variation - the bacteria must be self-sufficient, another vriation - the bacteria can have only some of the missing genes and some specific organic molecules should be added in the culture media in this case, etc.); one table must contain all of the defence systems of this specific bacteria (including but not limited to restriction-modification systems, abi systems, crispr/cas systems, etc.; for r-m systems information on what is the closest analogue to it from other known bacteria should also be given) with exact functions, recognition sites (if applicable), missing elements - and after the table a textual analysis should be given on what exactly this means for this particular species; one table must contain all the reparation and recombination systems of this bacteria with focus on homologous and non-homologous recombination with exact genes, their function, missing elements/genes given - and after this table a comprehensive analysis and experimental design on how to do a crispr/cas editing of this organism and what elements are there or missing and should be added (e.g., are all the necessary recombination genes present for crispr/cas knock-in in this organism?, etc.) should be given; one table must have all the genes for the probiotic potential/action of this species (if there are any) with genes function included (these genes could be producers of bacteriocins, peptidases that can cleave cell-wall, producers of inhibitors, etc. - not limited to this list). Then, at the very end I want you to make a comprehensive textual report about what this organism can do, how can it be used for food or medicine biotechnology, how can it be improved via genetic engineering.
