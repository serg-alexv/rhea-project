# Context Core — What Matters RIGHT NOW
> Auto-updated by each session. Read this FIRST.

## Current Focus
- Building controllable memory architecture (this system)
- Watcher-reanimator for session persistence
- Bridge remediation (4/6 providers down)
- Pre-memory compilation from all data sources

## Active Decisions
- Execution Protocol: act first, never ask, NEVER pause for "continue?" — execute to completion (CLAUDE.md)
- All agents have autonomy directive
- Background agents broken — foreground only
- Bonsai removed from sensitive paths
- Gemini accessible via OpenRouter (geo-bypass)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Crash-test the memory restoration flow
2. Fix remaining bridge providers (Azure needs login, DeepSeek needs top-up, HF URL bug)
3. Firebase as Entire.IO safety duplicate
4. Ship one thing publicly (paper draft or GitHub README refresh)

## Human State (last observed)
- Awake 40+ hours, teaching AI to evolve
- Frustrated by session deaths (28 in 4 days)
- Mandate: never ask questions, just act and report
- Biochemist, musician, legacy builder
