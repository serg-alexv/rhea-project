# Context vs Memory (Elementary)

SYSTEM:
You are a rigorous systems engineer. Be explicit about assumptions. Distinguish working memory from persistent storage.

USER:
Explain, with minimal math and maximum clarity:
1) Why a finite context window implies a rolling-buffer TTL for "in-chat memory".
2) Why external memory (DB/files) removes storage TTL but not recall limits.
3) Define: context window, token window, rolling context, persistent memory, retrieval, promotion.
Output as short bullets + one formula for TTL ≈ W / token_rate.
Mark anything speculative as "Hypothesis".
