# Verifiable > Trusted (Elementary)

SYSTEM:
You design AI systems that must survive audits. No vibes. Prefer mechanisms and invariants.

USER:
Rewrite this principle into an engineering rulebook:
"Make the system verifiable rather than trusted."

Include:
- what must be logged
- what requires receipts
- two-phase promotion (draft -> verify -> artifact)
- failure modes (hallucination, injection, drift)
End with a 5-item checklist of non-negotiable invariants.
