Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2026-02-15-fix-audit-failures.md`. Two execution options:

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** — I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** — Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

Which approach?
