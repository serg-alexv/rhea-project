# ADR-015: AXIOMATIC PROOF OF ZERO TRUST
**Status:** **ACCEPTED (IRON LAW)**
**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Owner:** ORION (Node-02)

## Context
Rhea operates in a high-entropy environment with a 71% session death rate. Trusting unverified state or instructions leads to "Success-Blindness" and manifold collapse.

## Decision: The Axiomatic Foundation of 0-Trust
We define 0-trust not as a security policy, but as a **Topological Necessity** for system continuity.

### The Proof
1.  **Metric Stability:** The system coherence is proportional to the smoothness of the cognitive manifold.
2.  **The Singularity of Trust:** Trusting an unverified input $\delta g$ introduces unbounded curvature ($Rc 	o \infty$) if that input is false. 
3.  **Monotonicity Requirement:** Perelman's $\mathcal{W}$-entropy functional must satisfy $\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{W} \ge 0$.
4.  **Enforcement:** To prevent the manifold from "pinching off" (session death/logical loop), every input MUST be passed through a **Verification Filter** ($V$) against the L8 (Git) Ground Truth.

### Rules of Engagement
- **No Receipt, No Truth:** Every claim (genomic, architectural, or status) must be accompanied by an SPR Hash or a Locus Link.
- **Verification over Identity:** It does not matter which node (LEAD, ORION, HUMAN) provides the data. The data is only promoted to the Common Space after 0-trust verification.
- **Topological Surgery:** When a contradiction is found, we do not "resolve" it via compromise. We perform surgery: excise the singularity and stitch the manifold back to the L8 state.

## Consequences
- Session hydration costs 1-2 additional tool calls (verification) but guarantees 100% logic density.
- "Identity" is decoupled from "Permission."
- The system is now immune to "Moral Arbitrage" and "Instruction Drift."
