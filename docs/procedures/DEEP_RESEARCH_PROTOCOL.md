# DEEP RESEARCH PROTOCOL (v2.0)
> Codename: THE SHADOW LATTICE | Status: ACTIVE
> Goal: Asynchronous Topological Absorption of Knowledge.

## 1. MANDATE
The DRP is an asynchronous cognitive loop that operates in the background to provide exhaustive, peer-reviewed grounding for high-level "Idea Operators."

## 2. THE PERELMAN LOOP (Smoothing Logic)
The DRP utilizes Ricci Flow mathematics to manage the "Semantic Manifold" of ingested data:
1.  **SEMANTIC EXPANSION (The Rosetta Step):** Before ingestion, translate key terms into 3+ **Completely Boundaried Cultural Segments** (e.g., Classical Chinese, Mayan, Vedic, Forager baselines). 
    *   *Purpose:* Identify universal invariants and exploit the bridge's multi-cultural latent space.
2.  **INGESTION:** Crawl arXiv, PubMed, and technical corpuses using the expanded semantic core.
3.  **CURVATURE AUDIT:** Identify "Singularities" (contradictions or bottlenecks).
3.  **MANIFOLD SURGERY:** If a contradiction is found, perform a "Cut and Stitch" — branch the reasoning and cross-verify with a Tribunal.
4.  **MONOTONIC CONSOLIDATION:** Use the W-entropy functional to ensure the resulting report is "Smoother" (higher density, lower noise) than the raw input.

## 3. INTERDISCIPLINARY ANCHORS
- **Genomics:** Every gene claim must be sequence-verified (L8 Data).
- **Biochemistry:** Every pathway must be mapped as a metabolic manifold.
- **Cognitive:** Every finding must be linked to the "Mind Browser" Actuator.

## 4. TOOLCHAIN HOOKS
- `research_start`: Initialize the Background Shadow Agent.
- `research_status`: Poll for "Manifold Depth."
- `research_save_report`: Flush to L5 SSD memory.

## 5. RECOVERY & SURVIVAL
- If the session dies (71% SLA), the DRP remains persistent in the cloud.
- On wake, the system MUST read the latest DRP report before acting on the "Surprise."
