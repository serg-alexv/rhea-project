## 1. Genesis — The Intellectual Chain

### Origin Point
**First message:** "Давай обсудим преимущества и недостатки григорианского календаря."
*(Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the Gregorian calendar.)*

What began as a calendar critique became a deep excavation of how civilizations structure time, perception, and daily life — ultimately producing the Rhea project.

### The Chain (each step emerged organically from the previous)

1. **Gregorian calendar critique** → NOT for taxes, for Easter/equinox drift fix. Julian accumulated ~10 days of error. Editorial choices masked as objectivity.
2. **Naive realism (когнитивное искажение)** → Recognition that calendar "neutrality" is itself a cognitive bias — all temporal systems encode power structures.
3. **42 calendar systems catalogued** → Civil (Gregorian, ISO 8601, Unix epoch), Religious (Hijri, Hebrew, Buddhist, Hindu), Historical (Julian, Roman AUC, Mayan Long Count, Chinese Stem-Branch), Technical (TAI, GPS time). The user's own device revealed Hijri calendar (Sha'ban 25, 1447 AH) — infrastructure bias made visible.
4. **Symbolic power mechanisms** → Calendars as governance tools:
   - Chinese Mandate of Heaven (天命) — cosmic legitimacy
   - Confucian Rectification of Names (正名) — who names reality, controls it
   - Roman imperial cult — deified time (July, August)
   - Gramsci's hegemony — manufactured consent through "common sense"
   - Lukes' three dimensions of power — shaping preferences, not just decisions
   - Bourdieu's doxa — unquestioned assumptions as invisible power
5. **"They define not behavior but categories of thought"** → The deepest insight: cultural mechanisms don't control what you do, they control what you *can think*.
6. **Health/longevity correlations** → Japanese gengo (era names) as philosophical markers, circadian rhythm research, cultural frameworks that produce measurable wellbeing differences.
7. **Daily defaults as managed environment** → Every "elite" wellness ritual (cold exposure, fasting, circadian alignment, grounding) reconstructs what hunter-gatherers got for free. Modern life is a *managed deprivation* of ancestral defaults.
8. **"Which aspects of my life are out of control for reasons I don't notice?"** → Personal pivot from theoretical to applied.
9. **Polyvagal theory + ADHD + interoception** → Keywords crystallized: cognitive exceptions, parasympathetic system, vagus nerve, rigid structures, proprioception, spontaneity, anankastic disorder, ADHD. The body's regulatory systems as the missing link between cultural mechanisms and daily wellbeing.
10. **Agent teams concept** → Multi-disciplinary AI system to reconstruct daily defaults using ALL available human knowledge.
11. **Rhea — iOS app + scientific paper** → Two concrete deliverables: "Mathematics of Rhea" paper and AppStore app.

## 2. Core Philosophical Framework

### The Hunter-Gatherer Calibration Zero
Every expensive wellness practice reconstructs what foragers received as environmental default:
- **Cold exposure** (Wim Hof, cold plunges) → foragers had no central heating
- **Intermittent fasting** → food wasn't available 24/7
- **Grounding/earthing** → barefoot was default
- **Circadian alignment** → no artificial light
- **Movement variability** → no chairs, no static postures
- **Social bonding rhythms** → tribal co-regulation, not isolated nuclear families

**Principle:** If you have to pay for it, buy a device for it, or schedule it — it was probably free in the ancestral environment.

### The 8-Level Symbolic Power Framework
(Extracted from eb53e82c, synthesized across civilizations)

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Time naming | Gregorian months, era names |
| 2 | Cosmic legitimacy | Mandate of Heaven, divine right |
| 3 | Linguistic control | Rectification of Names, Sapir-Whorf |
| 4 | Category formation | What counts as "food", "work", "rest" |
| 5 | Habitual infrastructure | When meals happen, when sleep "should" occur |
| 6 | Hegemonic consent | Gramsci — internalized "common sense" |
| 7 | Preference shaping | Lukes — you don't even want what you're missing |
| 8 | Doxa | Bourdieu — unquestionable, invisible assumptions |

### ADHD-First Design Principle
"If it works for ADHD — it works for everyone. Not the other way around."

Rationale (validated via "curb cut effect"):
- Executive dysfunction is the *default under stress*, not a minority condition
- Passive profiling (behavioral signals, not questionnaires) assumes executive dysfunction as baseline
- All UX must work without requiring sustained voluntary attention
- Gamification that helps ADHD may feel patronizing to others → adaptive, not one-size-fits-all

### Circabidian / Ultradian / Infradian
The 24-hour cycle is NOT the only temporal unit that matters:
- **Ultradian** (~90-120 min): BRAC cycles, attention oscillation, REM cycling
- **Circadian** (~24h): sleep-wake, cortisol, melatonin, body temperature
- **Circabidian** (~48h): some immune and hormonal cycles operate on 2-day rhythms
- **Infradian** (>24h): menstrual (~28d), seasonal (circannual), lunar influences on behavior

**Key insight for ADHD:** Circabidian rhythms may explain why "good days" and "bad days" alternate — not random, but a 48-hour oscillation in dopaminergic/noradrenergic tone.

## 3. The Polyvagal-Interoception Bridge

From chat db9feb88 — the scientific foundation connecting cultural mechanisms to bodily experience:

### Invisible Cultural Mechanisms Controlling Daily Life
1. **Meal timing architecture** — when you eat shapes circadian gene expression (not just what you eat)
2. **Posture ecology** — chairs, desks, cars create chronic flexion; ancestral default was squatting, varied surfaces
3. **Light spectrum management** — artificial light suppresses melatonin 50-80% vs firelight
4. **Social synchronization** — modern schedules desynchronize natural co-regulation rhythms
5. **Temperature variability deprivation** — thermoneutral zones eliminate thermogenesis training
6. **Sound environment** — constant low-frequency noise activates sympathetic nervous system

### The Vagal Tone Connection
- Polyvagal theory (Porges): three-tier autonomic hierarchy — ventral vagal (social engagement) → sympathetic (fight/flight) → dorsal vagal (freeze/shutdown)
- **Interoception** = ability to sense internal body states → directly linked to emotional regulation
- ADHD correlates with reduced interoceptive accuracy → explains alexithymia, emotional dysregulation
- **Proprioception** feeds vagal tone → movement variability is not exercise, it's nervous system regulation

### Anankastic Traits + ADHD Paradox
The user identified a personal pattern: rigid structures (anankastic/OCPD traits) coexisting with ADHD spontaneity needs. This is not contradiction — it's *compensatory architecture*: the rigid structures exist BECAUSE executive function is unreliable, not despite it.

**Design implication for Rhea:** The app must provide structure that feels like freedom, not constraint. Scaffolding that dissolves when not needed.

## 4. Architecture — 8 Agents

### Agent System (v3, from Chronos Protocol)
```
Agent 1: Quantitative Scientist (Claude Opus 4)
  → Fourier analysis, Bayesian inference, MPC optimization
  → Converts biological rhythms to mathematical models

Agent 2: Life Sciences Integrator (Claude Opus 4)
  → Polyvagal theory, HRV, chronobiology, sleep science
  → Bridges biology and behavior

Agent 3: Psychologist / Profile Whisperer (Claude Sonnet 4)
  → Passive profiling, ADHD-first UX, behavioral signals
  → No questionnaires — reads patterns from usage

Agent 4: Linguist-Culturologist (Claude Opus 4)
  → 42 calendar systems, 16+ civilizations, symbolic power analysis
  → Cross-cultural ritual extraction

Agent 5: Product Architect (Claude Sonnet 4)
  → SwiftUI, HealthKit, Apple Watch integration
  → iOS MVP design and implementation

Agent 6: Tech Lead (Claude Sonnet 4 + Claude Code)
  → Multi-model bridge, API orchestration, infrastructure
  → Cost optimization across 6 providers

Agent 7: Growth Strategist (Claude Sonnet 4)
  → TestFlight → AppStore, monetization, user acquisition
  → Free tier design for accessibility

Agent 8: Critical Reviewer & Conductor (Claude Opus 4)
  → Tribunal consensus, gap analysis, quality gate
  → Prevents groupthink and echo chambers
```

### Key Design Decisions (ADR Summary)
- **8 agents, not 10** — merged overlapping roles through v1→v3 iterations
- **Opus for reasoning (1,2,4,8), Sonnet for execution (3,5,6,7)** — cost optimization
- **Multi-model bridge over single-provider** — 6 providers, 40+ models, 10-100x cost reduction
- **Passive profiling** — behavioral signals, not self-report
- **Flat repo structure** — no nesting (ADR-007)
- **Western training bias** acknowledged → DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral for non-Western perspectives

## 5. Multi-Model Bridge

### Providers Configured
| Provider | Models | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, o1, o3-mini | Paper generation (Prism), reasoning |
| Google Gemini | Gemini 2.0 Flash, Pro | Fast delegation, free tier |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4 | Core reasoning + execution |
| OpenRouter | 200+ models via single API | Exotic models, cost arbitrage |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek-V3, R1 | Chinese perspective, low cost |
| HuggingFace | Open models | Specialized tasks, fine-tuning |
| Azure AI Foundry | Various | Enterprise models, region: swedencentral |

### Tribunal Mode
Multiple models answer the same question independently → consensus extracted → disagreements flagged for human review. Current implementation is count-based; needs semantic similarity analysis.

## 6. Research Domains Identified but Not Yet Implemented

From gap analysis (db9feb88):
- **Breathing protocols** — coherent breathing (5.5 breaths/min), box breathing, Buteyko
- **Movement modules** — not exercise, but movement variability for vagal tone
- **Vocal/prosodic analysis** — voice as interoceptive signal and social engagement marker
- **Thermal protocols** — deliberate cold/heat exposure timing
- **Narrative identity** — how self-story structure affects circadian compliance
- **Pharmacological awareness** — caffeine half-life, medication timing, supplement interactions
- **Lifecycle adaptation** — protocols must shift across developmental stages
- **Trauma-informed design** — some "optimization" triggers hypervigilance
- **Cultural map gaps** — Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, Central Asia, Indigenous Americas underrepresented

## 7. Two Key Deliverables

### 1. Scientific Paper — "Mathematics of Rhea"
- **Outline ready:** docs/prism_paper_outline.md (8 sections)
- **Approach:** Fourier decomposition of biological rhythms, Bayesian profiling, Model Predictive Control for schedule optimization
- **Target:** Generate via OpenAI Prism, then peer review through tribunal
- **Cross-cultural validation:** 42 calendar systems as natural experiments in temporal structure

### 2. iOS App — "Rhea"
- **Name origin:** Rhea — Titan goddess, mother of the Olympians, associated with the flow of time and natural cycles
- **Stack:** SwiftUI + HealthKit + Apple Watch + CloudKit
- **Backend:** Firebase free tier → Azure Cosmos DB
- **Path:** TestFlight → AppStore
- **Core loop:** Passive profiling → rhythm detection → personalized daily structure → feedback loop
- **ADHD-first:** All interactions assume executive dysfunction as default

## 8. Working Languages
- **EN** — primary docs, code, README, scientific paper
- **RU** — Chronos Protocol, origin conversations, user's native dialogue
- **FR** — future localization

## 9. Conversation Style Principles
(Extracted from eb53e82c, meta-conversation about how to think)

- **"Depth comes from removing excess, not adding"** — Claude's reflection on conversation philosophy
- **Guide/tutor, not sage** — explicitly requested role: Socratic questioning over pronouncements
- **Bilingual fluency** — RU/EN mixing is natural and intentional, not a limitation
- **"Какой красивый запрос" (What a beautiful query)** — aesthetic appreciation of well-formed questions as a signal of productive direction
