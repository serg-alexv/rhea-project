# Rhea — React PWA Vision
> Status: FUTURE LAYER — do not invest until core memory model is stable
> Last updated: 2026-02-13

## Purpose

The PWA is Rhea's **face** — a visual interface for humans to interact with the
memory system, agents, and daily schedule. It is NOT the core intelligence.

## Priority Rule

Do NOT build PWA until:
1. Core memory model is stable (metrics/memory_metrics.json shows sustained "comfort")
2. LangGraph architecture has at least Phase 2 implementation
3. First live tribunal has been executed
4. iOS MVP scaffold exists (primary deliverable is native iOS, PWA is secondary)

## Planned Views

### 1. Dashboard — Rhea Status
- Current state vector `[E, M, C, S, O, R]` as gauges
- Discomfort level (comfort / warning / overload)
- Active agent indicator
- Last checkpoint timestamp

### 2. Episode Explorer
- Timeline of `.entire/snapshots/` entries
- Filter by type (BOOT, GENESIS, POST_COMMIT, etc.)
- Diff view between consecutive snapshots
- Link to git commits

### 3. Agent Graph Visualizer
- LangGraph state machine rendered as interactive graph
- Highlight current active node
- Show message flow between agents
- Oracle query/response log

### 4. Schedule View
- Daily schedule generated by MPC controller
- Circadian rhythm overlay
- Obligation blocks from calendar
- Body-state recommendations (body-first morning, etc.)

### 5. Task / Roadmap
- Render `data/challenging_tasks.yaml`
- Render `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Status tracking with priority colors

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite for build
- Deployed as PWA (service worker for offline)
- API: reads directly from repo files (or lightweight Express/Fastify server)

## Directory
When implemented: `ui/` at repo root.
Keep isolated — no imports from `src/` (bridge code) into UI.
Define API contracts in `docs/api_contracts.md` when ready.
